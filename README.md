- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @speak4us https://speak4.us

We are excited to announce the release of our new neural reader, which can read text aloud in 80 languages with 660 voices. This new version of our neural reader is powered by deep learning, which allows it to produce more natural sounding voices and read texts with greater accuracy.

The Speak4.us neural reader is available for free online and can be used to read texts in a variety of languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Persian, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Nepali, and Sinhalese.

To use the Speak4.us neural reader, simply paste or type the text you want to read into the text box on the website, select the language you want to hear it read in, and then click the "read text" button. The Speak4.us neural reader will then read the text aloud in a natural sounding voice.
